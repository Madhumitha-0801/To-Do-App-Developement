# To-Do-App-Developement
Develop a functional TO-DO app that allows users to manage their tasks. The  app should enable users to add, edit, and delete tasks, prioritize them, and  mark tasks as completed or pending. The app should also save tasks to local  storage for persistence.
Steps Taken:
1. Setup Project Structure:
 Created the basic project structure with index.html, styles.css, and 
script.js files.
2. HTML Structure:
 Added basic HTML elements for the TO-DO app including an input 
field for new tasks, a priority dropdown, an add task button, and a 
task list.
3. CSS Styling:
 Styled the input field, priority dropdown, add button, and task list 
for a clean and user-friendly interface.
 Implemented different border colors for tasks based on their 
priority (low, medium, high).
4. JavaScript Functionality:
 Implemented functions to add tasks, edit tasks, delete tasks, and 
toggle task completion status.
 Integrated local storage to save and load tasks.
5. Priority Placeholder:
 Added a placeholder option in the priority dropdown.
6. Task Status Toggle:
 Used Font Awesome icons to visually indicate task status 
(completed or pending).
 Styled the toggle button to change icons based on task status.
Challenges Faced:
 Priority Placeholder Implementation: Ensuring the placeholder option 
in the priority dropdown is correctly implemented and does not get 
selected as a valid option.
 Task Status Icons: Integrating Font Awesome icons and ensuring they 
switch correctly between completed and pending statuses.
 Local Storage Integration: Ensuring tasks are correctly saved and loaded 
from local storage, maintaining task priority and completion status.
Solutions Implemented:
 Used the disabled and hidden attributes for the placeholder option in 
the dropdown to ensure it is not selectable.
 Implemented a function to toggle task completion status and 
dynamically update the icon class using JavaScript.
 Utilized JSON parsing and stringifying methods to store and retrieve 
tasks from local storage, maintaining their properties.
Learnings:
 Gained a deeper understanding of manipulating the DOM using 
JavaScript.
 Learned how to effectively use local storage for persisting data across 
sessions.
 Enhanced skills in CSS for creating responsive and user-friendly 
interfaces.
 Improved knowledge in handling user input and dynamically updating 
the UI based on user actions.
Project Update:
 The TO-DO app is now fully functional with all required features 
implemented.
 Users can add, edit, delete, and prioritize tasks.
 Task status can be toggled between completed and pending, with visual 
feedback using Font Awesome icons.
 All tasks are saved to local storage, ensuring data persistence.
 The app has been tested for basic functionality and usability.
Next steps could include further testing, implementing additional features such 
as task deadlines or categories, and optimizing the app for performance and 
accessibility
